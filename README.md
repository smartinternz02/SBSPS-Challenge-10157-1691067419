Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning

This project objective is to build two machine learning models:-

---> One to predict whether the candidate is placed or not, using "Gradient Booster Classifier" algorithm

---> Other one is to predict salary if placed, using "Support Vector Regression" algorithm

These models are trained using the "Campus Recruitment" dataset from kaggle ---> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement

---> Software requirements (commands for python packages should be installed inorder to run this project):

      >pip install flask
      
      >pip install pandas
      
      >pip install scikit-learn==1.1.1
      
      >pip install requests
